An SGs Serving RFSS is registered to the SGs Home RFSS. The SGs Home
RFSS initiates and then cancels an unconfirmed group call.

Applicable ISSI Conformance Test RFSS Roles: Serving, Home (to Serving),
Home (Multi-Segment).

Note: Generation of the CANCEL message is optional, and functionality which is
essentially equivalent can be provided via the BYE message. Accordingly, a
Home RFSS which does not support the CANCEL functionality in this test may
still be claimed as conformant to this PCP. This test is deemed Not Applicable
to such a Home RFSS.
Note: Serving RFSS has the option to respond immediately with a 200 OK. In
such a case, this test becomes not applicable.

<description>
An unconfirmed group call setup between an SGs Home and two Serving
RFSSs is successful. The first Serving RFSS sends multiple PTT Transmit
Progress messages with no request at the beginning of the talk-spurt, and then
stops transmitting.

Applicable ISSI Conformance Test RFSS Roles: Serving, Home (to Serving),
Home (Multi-Segment)

Note: Generation of the PTT Transmit Progress without a prior PTT Transmit
Request message is optional, and is not necessarily essential to the transmission
control capabilities of the Serving RFSS. Accordingly, a Serving RFSS which
does not generate the PTT Transmit Progress message as described in this test
may still be claimed as conformant to this PCP. This test is deemed Not
Applicable to such a Serving RFSS.

<description>
A trigger in the Calling Serving RFSS initiates a protected mode SU-to-SU call
addressed to an SU registered in the Called Serving RFSS. All RFSSs have
available RF resources and RTP resources for the SU-to-SU call. The Called
Home RFSS determines whether the call is protected or not.

The two following cases are covered:
1- The Called Home RFSS is configured to accept the protected mode for
the called SU, and the calling SU requests the protected mode. In this
case, the call is set up with the protected option.
2- The Called Home RFSS is configured to accept the unprotected mode for
the called SU, and the calling SU requests the unprotected mode. In this
case, the call is set up with the unprotected option.

A Calling Serving RFSS initiates an SU-to-SU call addressed to an SU registered
in the Called Serving RFSS. While awaiting the response for the call, the Called
RFSS initiates an SU-to-SU call addressed to the Calling SU. The SU-to-SU call
initiated by the Called RFSS has higher priority than the SU-to-SU call originated
by the Calling RFSS. The collision between the two calls is detected and
mitigated by the Called Serving RFSS.

The following three cases are covered. The three must be passed to pass this
test.
1- The Calling Serving RFSS initiates the call with the Availability Check
option enabled but the called SU is only able to support Direct Call.
2- The Calling Serving RFSS initiates the call with the Availability Check
option disabled and the called SU is able to support Direct Call.
3- The Calling Serving RFSS initiates the call without the Availability Check
option enabled but the called SU is able to support call with availability
check.
NOTE 1: Only the third case is described in section 12.8.5. For the two other
cases, the SIP Ringing message is never sent out and the field c-pref is present
in the appropriate SIP INVITE and 200 OK message as described in BACA-A
and specifically tested in sections 12.1and 12.2.
NOTE 2: In case of SU-to-SU calls with equal priority, the called Home RFSS
considers that the call to be declined is the one initiated for the SU having the
lowest SUID.

A Calling Serving RFSS initiates an SU-to-SU call. The Called Home RFSS
detects that the request with the chosen mode cannot be granted.
Two variations of this test are described here. Both must be validated in order to
pass the test:
1- The calling SU requests protected mode. In this case, the Called Home
RFSS is configured to not accept protected mode.
2- The calling SU requests unprotected mode. In this case, the Called Home
RFSS is configured to not accept unprotected mode.

In both cases, the call is not setup.

NOTE:
Only the first case is described in section 12.13.5. In the second case, the cprotected
parameter is set to 0 or is not present and the p25-condition-code and
P25-condition-text in the 403 Forbidden message will be set to 2C and
"Unprotected audio call not granted", respectively.

2- Messages between the calling Home and the called Home, between the
called Home and the called Serving or sent by the calling Home RFSS
and received by the calling Serving RFSS are the same as between the
calling Serving RFSS and the calling Home RFSS. The difference is on
the field SSRC and fields in small font and in italic in the messages
described in the section Signaling parameters below. The Heartbeat
Query messages between all of these configurations of RFSS roles are
part of this conformance test.
3- Generation of the Heartbeat Query message is optional when initiated by
a Calling Serving RFSS, a Called Serving RFSS, and finally a Calling
Home RFSS when the heartbeat query is addressed to a Called Home
RFSS. These optional procedures are not necessarily essential to the
transmission control capabilities of the RFSS. Accordingly, an RFSS
which does not generate the Heartbeat Query message as described in
this test may still be claimed as conformant to this PCP. This test is
deemed Not Applicable to such an RFSS.
