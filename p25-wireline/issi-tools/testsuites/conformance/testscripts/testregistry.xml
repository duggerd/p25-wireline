An SGs Serving RFSS is registered to the SGs Home RFSS. The SGs Home
RFSS initiates and then cancels an unconfirmed group call.

Applicable ISSI Conformance Test RFSS Roles: Serving, Home (to Serving),
Home (Multi-Segment).

Note: Generation of the CANCEL message is optional, and functionality which is
essentially equivalent can be provided via the BYE message. Accordingly, a
Home RFSS which does not support the CANCEL functionality in this test may
still be claimed as conformant to this PCP. This test is deemed Not Applicable
to such a Home RFSS.
Note: Serving RFSS has the option to respond immediately with a 200 OK. In
such a case, this test becomes not applicable.

1- The calling SU requests the protected mode and the Home RFSS is
configured to refuse the protected mode for the considered SG.
2- The calling SU requests the unprotected mode and the Home RFSS is
configured to refuse the unprotected mode for the considered SG.
In both cases, the call is not setup.

NOTE:
Only the first case is described in section 9.10.5. In the second case, the cprotected
parameter is set to 0 and the p-25-condition-code and P25-conditiontext
in the 403 Forbidden message will be set to 2C and "Unprotected audio call
not granted", respectively.

An unconfirmed group call is set up between a Home RFSS and a Serving
RFSS. The Serving RFSS starts transmitting and after a while, the Home RFSS
mutes and then unmutes the transmission. The purpose of this test is to check
that the first Serving RFSS stops sending audio when the Home RFSS sends a
Mute request and resumes transmitting audio when the Home RFSS sends an
Unmute request.

<description>
A trigger in the Calling Serving RFSS initiates a full or half-duplex mode SU-to-
SU call addressed to an SU registered in the Called Serving RFSS. The Calling
Home RFSS, the Called Home RFSS and the Called Serving RFSS do not reject
the request coming from the Calling Serving RFSS to initiate the SU-to-SU call.
All RFSSs have available RF resources and RTP resources for the SU-to-SU
call. The Calling SU and Called SU both support the full duplex and half duplex
modes.

The following three cases are covered. The three must be passed to pass this
test.
1- The Calling Serving RFSS initiates the call with the Availability Check
option enabled but the called SU is only able to support Direct Call.
2- The Calling Serving RFSS initiates the call with the Availability Check
option disabled and the called SU is able to support Direct Call.
3- The Calling Serving RFSS initiates the call without the Availability Check
option enabled but the called SU is able to support call with availability
check.

NOTE: Only the third case is described in section 12.3.5. For the two other
cases, the SIP Ringing message is never sent out and the field c-pref is present
in the appropriate SIP INVITE and 200 OK message as described in BACA-A

A trigger in the Calling Serving RFSS initiates a full or half-duplex mode SU-to-
SU call addressed to an SU registered in the Called Serving RFSS. The Calling
Home RFSS, the Called Home RFSS and the Called Serving RFSS do not reject
the request coming from the Calling Serving RFSS to initiate the SU-to-SU call.
All RFSSs have available RF resources and RTP resources for the SU-to-SU
call. The Calling SU and Called SU both support the full duplex and half duplex
modes.

The following three cases are covered. The three must be passed to pass this
test.
1- The Calling Serving RFSS initiates the call with the Availability Check
option enabled but the called SU is only able to support Direct Call.
2- The Calling Serving RFSS initiates the call with the Availability Check
option disabled and the called SU is able to support Direct Call.
3- The Calling Serving RFSS initiates the call without the Availability Check
option enabled but the called SU is able to support call with availability
check.

NOTE: Only the third case is described in section 12.3.5. For the two other
cases, the SIP Ringing message is never sent out and the field c-pref is present
in the appropriate SIP INVITE and 200 OK message as described in BACA-A

A Calling Serving RFSS initiates an SU-to-SU call addressed to an SU registered
in the Called Serving RFSS. While awaiting the response for the call, the Called
RFSS initiates an SU-to-SU call addressed to the Calling SU. The SU-to-SU call
initiated by the Called RFSS has higher priority than the SU-to-SU call originated
by the Calling RFSS. The collision between the two calls is detected and
mitigated by the Called Serving RFSS.

The following three cases are covered. The three must be passed to pass this
test.
1- The Calling Serving RFSS initiates the call with the Availability Check
option enabled but the called SU is only able to support Direct Call.
2- The Calling Serving RFSS initiates the call with the Availability Check
option disabled and the called SU is able to support Direct Call.
3- The Calling Serving RFSS initiates the call without the Availability Check
option enabled but the called SU is able to support call with availability
check.
NOTE 1: Only the third case is described in section 12.8.5. For the two other
cases, the SIP Ringing message is never sent out and the field c-pref is present
in the appropriate SIP INVITE and 200 OK message as described in BACA-A
and specifically tested in sections 12.1and 12.2.
NOTE 2: In case of SU-to-SU calls with equal priority, the called Home RFSS
considers that the call to be declined is the one initiated for the SU having the
lowest SUID.

A Calling Serving RFSS initiates an SU-to-SU call. The Called Home RFSS
detects that the request with the chosen mode cannot be granted.
Two variations of this test are described here. Both must be validated in order to
pass the test:
1- The calling SU requests protected mode. In this case, the Called Home
RFSS is configured to not accept protected mode.
2- The calling SU requests unprotected mode. In this case, the Called Home
RFSS is configured to not accept unprotected mode.

In both cases, the call is not setup.

NOTE:
Only the first case is described in section 12.13.5. In the second case, the cprotected
