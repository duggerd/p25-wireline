This defines the global configuration of the distributed test system.
The distributed test system consists of one or more daemons which are
started at specified IP addresses and which listen for commands 
sent to it through specified HTTP Ports. A daemon can consist
of a tester service  and a packet monitoring service. These are 
indepenedent services.

<!-- 
Specifies a diets daemon which manages a conformance testing 
service and a packet monitoring service and runs at a specified IP 
address.

<!ELEMENT diets-daemon (refid+) >


<!-- 
Specifies a reference ID for the daemon. A single daemon can have
several reference IDs. RFSSs are mappings from the system topology 
to map an Rfss to a daemon instance. WARNING Edit with care.

<!-- 
@attr id a symbolic name assigned to the daemon. The default ID is the ip 
address of the node. This id can be referenced in the systemtopology.xml
file for the test suite.

<!--
@attr name is the daemon name. 
@attr httpPort is the port where the conformance testing service may be
contacted. This defaults to 8763. If this port conficts on your machine,
then you may override this property using this attribute but make sure that
the DIETS daemon on the target machine is running at the appropriate
address.

@attr isConformanceTester a flag that indicates whether conformance testing
	services are enabled for this daemon

@attr isPacketMonitor a flag that indicates whether or not packet monitoring
	services are enabled for this daemon.
