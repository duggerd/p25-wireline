<!-- 
The ISSI emulation consists of multiple rfsss, su's and groups.  
The global topology configuration file specifies the SUs and group
assignments for the given test suite. You will have to configure
your unit under test to be aware of these user and group
IDs, home RFSSs etc. The global topology references
RFSS entities that are defined in the associated
"systemtopology.xml" file. Note that the Rfss IDs reference
those that are defined in the "systemtopology.xml" and these
are also referenced in each individual test case 
topology.xml file. Therefore these names should
not be changed for a given test suite.

<!-- The top level tag for the configuration of global topology. The global topology is the global assignment of SUs and Groups to RFSSs across all 
tests int he system. You should configure your test system to be aware of the SU's and Gruoups specified in this file.

<!--
@attr rfssName The RFSS name. This must refer to an 
		RFSS defined in the associated systemtopology.xml 
		file. Do not change this assignment for a given
		test suite otherwise the test scripts that 
		refer to this name may break.
@attr selftestPort The port used for self test trace generation.
		Selftest involves running the scenario for each emulated
		RFSS using localhost (127.0.0.1) and selftestPort for 
		SIP signaling call setup. The generated traces is
		IP address and port independent. This can be any
		random integer.
