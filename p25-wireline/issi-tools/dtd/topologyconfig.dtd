<!-- 
This document allows you to specialize the configuration of 
the emulated RFSSs involved in a test. 
The ISSI emulation consists of multiple RFSSs, SU's and groups that are defined in the associated
systemtopology.xml file for a test suite and inherited by the globaltopology.xml file for that test suite.
The globaltopolgy.xml file is where you set SU and group associations. Here is where you define
things like Group membership and other test specific behabiors. In this file you will specify user and group profiles as well as timers, registration
and other such information. This is a specialization of the attributes of these emulated entities that are defined
in the corresponding global-topology.xml file. The contents of the xml document are interpreted in the context of an
associated globaltopology.xml. The rfss names and group names here are tied to the rfss and group names that
are defined in globlatopology.xml.

@attr THEARTBEAT Timer values that you can set up ( override defaults) for this test.
@attr traceOrder Comma separated list of rfss names for ordering the vertical lines of the sequence diagram
	to make it more readable. If this attribute is left out, then the trace is ordered in the order
	of sent messages (i.e. if RFSS_A sends a message before RFSS_B then it appears before RFSS_B
	in the sequence diagram ).

An unknown unit is a unit that the RFSS does not know about. 
No nested tags for this  one. An RFSS that sees PTT request from
an unknown Unit will reject the PTT Request.

will not allow to register an SU from for the given SUID. 

-->

<!-- 

A group configuration tag. A group is statically configured 
with one or more subscribers. Each subscriber is an SU. A group has a group 
profile that is stored at the group home.

@attr rfssName the rfssName (inherited from globaltopology.xml). 

@attr operation This is a local policy for the home RFSS for the given SU.
	It defines what REGISTER operations are allowable from a given RFSS.
	This addresses tests which generate FORBIDDEN responses from an RFSS. This attribute
	allows you to specify a local policy on registration.

<!-- 
@attr id	- the id for this tag. Can be referred to in a script.

@attr rfssName  - The symbolic name which we use to  refer to the RFSS in the test system.
		This must reference an RFSS in the global topology file.
@attr servedSuLeaseTime - the time for which we keep registration 
			of a served Su (default is infinity or until the su moves)
@attr servedGroupLeaseTime  - the time for which we keep registration of a 
			served Group member (default is infinity or 
			until the group has no served SU in our range).
@attr groupRegistrationExpiresTime - the time for which the home 
			SU remembers its groups (default is infinity ).
@attr groupCallInviteProcessingTime - the time that the RFSS takes to 
			respond to a group call INVITE in seconds.
@attr rfResourcesAvailable - true if RF resources are available at the rfss.
@attr querySuCredentialsBeforeRegistration  if true, query before registration 
			when an unregistered SU  tries to register itself 
@attr queryGroupCredentialsBeforeRegistration if true, then before sending a 
			register to a group, query the group credentials first.
@attr registerConfirmTime  - time that it takes to confirm an SU 
	during Register CONFIRM processing. If non zero, a session
	progress 183 is sent out while the registration is being confrimed.

@attr isAdvancedRtpResourceManagementSupported  - a flag that indicates
	whether the RFSS supports advanced resource management.

@attr isInterestedInLosingAudio - a flag that indicates whether the RFSS
	is interested in losing audio.

@attr isCallingSuInitrans - a flag that controls the setting of c-initrans for
		su to su calls. This is used by the called home RFSS

@attr maxRtpPorts - the max number of available RTP ports 
         ( to emulate limited RTP resources ) .

	should be added on register-register.
@attr checkCallPermission - a flag that indicates the U2U call permission 
        should be checked.
