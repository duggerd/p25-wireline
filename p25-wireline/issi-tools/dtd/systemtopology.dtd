Defines the system topology for the emulator. The system topology is where you define System and WACN IDs as well as
the IP addresses and the ports where the emulated and actual components run. You define your RFSS IDs ( as defined in 
102 BACA ) here. This xml document is relevant to both the DIETS tester and the DIETS packet monitor.

@attr rfssName  - The symbolic name which we use to 
		refer to the RFSS in the test system.
@attr systemName - The system name to which this RFSS belongs

@attr rfssId      - is the rfss Id for the rfss.

@attr ipAddress   - is the Ip address where the Rfss will run. 
	This is a required parameter if the RFSS is not emulated.
	If the Rfss is emulated, a tag corresponding to thie RFSS must appear
        in issi-tester-configuration.xml.
	For example a tag <refId  id="rfss_1.daemon" /> 
        in issi-tester-configuration.xml implies that 
        emulated Rfss with name rfss_1 
	will run on the DIETS daemon.
	
@attr address   - is the address where the Rfss located. 

@attr port      - is the sip signaling port where the rfss 
		will accept incoming sip messages. This is a required
		parameter.

		
@attr emulated    - a true/false flag 
			that indicates whether the Rfss 
			is emulated or real.
			
@attr color - the color to use to fill the box on the graphical panel.
