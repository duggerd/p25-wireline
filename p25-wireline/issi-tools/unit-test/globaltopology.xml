<!-- This is a global topology file. It defines SUs and Groups 
The RFSS ids in the file refer to the values in systemtopology.xml,
The following are random ports.  Each SU and group defined
here has a default SU / Group profile. They can be overriden
in the topologyconfig.xml file for each test case.

IMPORTANT:  DO NOT change the RFSS names in this script and the SU 
names in this script. You are free to change the ID assignments and 
port assignments.
