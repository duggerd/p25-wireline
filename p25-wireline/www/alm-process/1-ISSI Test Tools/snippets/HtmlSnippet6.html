<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><p><font color="#000000">The ISSI conformance test case document&nbsp;is currently being developed by TIA TR-8, and it is expect that a formal published version of the ISSI conformance test document will be available in early 2009. These conformance tests will verify that the vendor implementation under test conforms at a message level to what has been specified in TIA-102.BACA-A.&nbsp; In order to objectively verify that a vendor conforms to TIA-102.BACA-A a reference implementation of the ISSI protocol stack has been developed.&nbsp; This software reference implementation is referred to as ISSI Test Tools (ITT).&nbsp; The development of&nbsp;this software was initially funded by NIST Office of Law Enforcement (OLES).&nbsp; </font></p><p><font color="#000000">Since&nbsp;ITT&nbsp;is implemented in Java, the software can be loaded on a regular desktop PC that has a Linux or Windows operating system on it.&nbsp; The roles&nbsp;ITT can emulate are&nbsp;calling serving RFSS, calling home RFSS, called home RFSS, and called serving RFSS.&nbsp;&nbsp;The preferred configuration when attempting to determine a particular vendor&rsquo;s conformance is to test a single vendor's ISSI in isolation.&nbsp; This scenario implies that there is only one vendor RFSS with a real ISSI and the rest of the ISSI interfaces are emulated by ITT.&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of emulated ISSIs and the role of the emulated interfaces will vary depending on the conformance test case under consideration.&nbsp; Since&nbsp;ITT does not currently have the capability to emulate the P25 common air interface, the behaviors of (or events generated by) subscriber units are emulated in the ITT software.&nbsp; The conformance tests are implemented in XML scripts.&nbsp; The user has the capability to modify the specific test parameters in these scripts as necessary.&nbsp; From the&nbsp;ITT GUI, the user selects a conformance test case to execute.&nbsp; After the test case has completed execution, the user can then view the SIP and RTP Push-to-Talk (PTT) messages that were exchanged between ISSIs in a graphical message sequence chart (MSC).&nbsp; Upon completion of test case execution, ITT will automatically declare either pass or fail.&nbsp; Raw IP packet data can be rendered by clicking on the message of interest in the MSC.</font></p>
