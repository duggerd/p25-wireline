<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><p>ISSI stands for Inter-RF Sub-System Interface, and it can essentially be thought of as an IP&nbsp;based network protocol that is able to utilize a standard COTS network interface card (NIC).&nbsp; The intent is for this interface to be present in future deployments of P25 Radio Frequency Sub-Systems (RFSS).&nbsp; The ISSI of different RFSS&rsquo;s can be inter-connected using various medium (for example Ethernet).&nbsp; When the ISSI&rsquo;s of various RFSSs are interconnect this allows IP packets that contain encoded voice to be transmitted and received.&nbsp; The ISSI is important to public safety agencies because it will foster competition amongst several vendors who manufacture RFSSs.&nbsp; This increased competition will essentially drive down the cost of P25 infrastructure over time.&nbsp; In addition to lower cost, the most important reason for having an ISSI interface is to promote interoperability between the different vendors who manufacture RFSSs.&nbsp; This allows the end consumer to implement a P25 communications network that consists of RFSSs from multiple vendors.</p>
